export const coach_rules_en = `1. Teacher Guidelines for Using the App
When using the Be Studio app, teachers should ensure that their personal information, course details, and schedule are always up to date. The system serves as the main platform for scheduling and notifications, so teachers are required to log in regularly to check class bookings, student lists, and system messages. Teachers must check in before the class and submit attendance records (if required) after the class. All course changes, leave, or substitute requests must be submitted through the system and will only take effect after being approved by the administrator.
\n
2. Course Publishing and Management Standards
Teachers can create courses in the system according to their expertise and authorization, and select the corresponding course type (e.g., fitness, dance, beauty, etc.). Each course must clearly state the course name, brief description, target audience, duration, class time, and maximum number of students. If changes to the course schedule are necessary, teachers are advised to submit applications at least 48 hours in advance to notify students who have already booked.
\n
3. Venue Usage Guidelines
When scheduling a class, teachers must also select a venue, and the system will automatically assign an available classroom. Before and after using the venue, teachers should ensure the classroom is tidy, equipment is returned, and power is turned off. If a class is expected to run beyond the original time slot, an extension must be requested in the system and approved by the administrator. Teachers are not allowed to change the classroom or extend the class time without prior permission.
\n
4. Equipment and Resource Management
Some courses (such as yoga or dance) may require specific equipment (yoga mats, speakers, microphones, etc.). Teachers should reserve any required equipment in advance through the app. Please take care of public property; any damages must be reported immediately and an equipment report must be filled out.
\n
5. Code of Conduct
Teachers are not allowed to use the system for personal promotions, unauthorized course publishing, or private student recruitment. All class income will be settled through the platform and teaching fees will be paid on a regular basis according to the rules. Teachers should maintain good platform order and uphold their professional image. In case of violations, the platform reserves the right to suspend the teacher's account.`;
